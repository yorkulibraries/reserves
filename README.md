There are 2 containers created: *reserves-web-1* and *reserves-dbl-1*

# Access the front end web app in DEVELOPMENT 

By default, the application will listen on port 4004 and runs with RAILS_ENV=development.

To access the application in Chrome browser, you will need to add the ModHeader extension to your Chrome browser.

Once the extension has been activated, you can add the following header to the site http://localhost:4004/. This will enable you to login as **manager** user.

Header: PYORK_USER

Value: manager

The application is now accessible at http://localhost:4004/
